# Abstract

## Workshop

This hands-on lab is designed to help attendees better understand how to build a Proof-of-Concept (POC) and conduct a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that will need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. In addition, attendees will help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as explore ways to migrate from an old version of SQL Server to the newest version and consider the impact of migrating from on-premises to the cloud.

Learning Objectives:

-   Migrate from Oracle to SQL Server using SQL Server Migration Assistant

-   Migrate between different SQL Server editions using Data Migration Assistant

-   Use advanced SQL Server features, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data store, table compression, Transparent Data Encryption, and clustered ColumnStore indexing

-   Consider the steps required to update existing applications to use the new data platform

-   Analyze and improve database performance

-   Implement high availability using Stretch Database and AlwaysOn Availability Groups
