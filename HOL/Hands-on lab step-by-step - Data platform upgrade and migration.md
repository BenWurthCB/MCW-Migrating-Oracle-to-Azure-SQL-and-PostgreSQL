# Data platform upgrade and migration hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to help attendees better understand how to build a Proof-of-Concept (POC) and conduct a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that will need to be updated, and come up with a migration plan. In addition, attendees will help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as explore ways to migrate from an old version of SQL Server to the newest version and consider the impact of migrating from on-premises to the cloud.

Learning Objectives:

-   Migrate from Oracle to SQL Server using SQL Server Migration Assistant

-   Migrate between different SQL Server editions using Data Migration Assistant

-   Use advanced SQL Server features, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data store, table compression, Transparent Data Encryption, and clustered ColumnStore indexing

-   Consider the steps required to update existing applications to use the new data platform

-   Analyze and improve database performance

-   Implement high availability using Stretch Database and AlwaysOn Availability Groups

## Overview

World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced significant growth in the last few years. In addition to predictable growth, they've had a substantial amount of growth in the data they store in their data warehouse. Their data warehouse is starting to show its age; slowing down during extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations and during critical queries. It was built on SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.

The WWI CIO has recently read about new performance enhancements of SQL Server 2017. She is excited about clustered ColumnStore indexes. In addition, she has chosen to upgrade to Enterprise Edition. She's hoping that table compression will improve performance, backup times, and lessen the load on the Storage Area Network (SAN).

WWI is concerned about upgrading their database to SQL Server 2017 or Azure SQL Database. The data warehouse has been successful for a long time. As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security. WWI wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it won't run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of SQL Server 2017.

WWI's CIO would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology will help ETL and query performance.

## Solution Architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram is divided in to Microsoft Azure, and On Premises. Microsoft Azure includes SQL Server 2017 in a VM as an Always On Secondary, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse for a stretch table. On Premise includes the following elements: API App for vendor connections; Web App for Internet Sales Transactions; ASP.NET Core App for inventory management; SQL Server 2017 OLTP for Always On and JSON store; SSRS 2017 for Reporting of OLTP, Data Warehouse, and Cubes; SSIS 2017 for a Data Warehouse Load; Excel for reporting; SQL Server 2017 Enterprise for a Data Warehouse; and SSAS 2017 for a Data Warehouse.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image2.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to perform an assessment to see what potentials issues need to be addressed in upgrading the database to SQL Server 2017 or Azure SQL Database. After correcting any issues, the SQL Server 2008 database is migrated to SQL Server 2017 Enterprise, using Data Migration Assistant. A shared folder is created for storing a backup of the database, which is used by Data Migration Assistant to move the database to SQL Server 2017. Two new features of SQL Server 2017, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be applied to demonstrate vale from the upgrade. For the ColumnStore Index, a new table based on the existing FactResellerSales table will be created, and a ColumnStore index applied. Next, the Oracle XE database supporting the application will be migrating to SQL Server 2017 Enterprise using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 7.x for Oracle. Once the Oracle database has been migrated, the NorthwindMVC application is updated, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle. The entity models are updated against SQL Server, and code updates are made to use the new Entity Framework context based on SQL Server. Corrections to stored procedures are made due to differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle versus SQL Server.

## Requirements

-   Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    -   Trial subscriptions will not work.

-   A virtual machine configured with:

13. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, expand your servers node, then Databases. You should see Northwind listed. 
    
    ![Northwind is highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image177.png "Verify the Northwind listing")

14. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, check the box next to NW, and make sure it is selected in the tree. 
    
    ![The NW schema is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image178.png "Confirm the NW schema")

15. In the SQL Server Metadata explorer, check the box next to Northwind. 
    
    ![Northwind is selected and highlighted under Databases in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image179.png "Select Northwind")

16. In the SSMA toolbar, select Convert Schema. There is a bug in SSMA which prevents this button to being properly enabled, so if the button is disabled, you can expand the NW node in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, which should cause the Convert Schema button to become enabled. You can also right-click on the NW database in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select Convert Schema if that does not work.
    
    ![Convert Schema is highlighted on the SSMA toolbar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image180.png "Select Convert Schema")

17. After about a minute the conversion should have completed.

18. In the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, observe that new schema objects have been added. For example, under Northwind, Schemas, NW, Tables you should see the tables from the Oracle database. 
    
    ![NW is selected in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer, and tables from the Oracle database are visible below that.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image181.png "Observe new schema objects")

19. In the output pane, you will notice a message that the conversion finished with 1 error, and 22 warnings. 
    
    ![The conversion message is highlighted in the Output window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image182.png "View the conversion message")

20. To view the errors, select the Errors List at the bottom of the SSMA screen. 
    
    ![Errors List is highlighted at the bottom of the SSMA screen.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image183.png "Select Errors List")

21. Select Warnings to hide the warnings, and leave only Errors displayed. 
    
    ![The Warnings notification is highlighted in the Errors List.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image184.png "Errors list")

22. Double-click on the error listed. This will display the Table in both Oracle and SQL Server that is causing the error, EMPLOYEETERRITORIES. Notice the Oracle table lists EMPLOYEEID with a data type of NUMBER, while SQL Server is expecting a data type of float(53). 
    
    ![NUMBER and float(53) are highlighted under Data Type, and EMPLOYEEID is selected in the split-screen views of the Table tab for Oracle and SQL Server.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image185.png "View the information")

23. Look at the table definition for the table on the Oracle side.

24. To change the data type, select the Type Mapping tab, select the row with source type of number, and select Edit.
    
    ![The Type Mapping tab is highlighted, and below that, the row with source type of number is highlighted, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image186.png "Change the data type")

25. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, set the Target type to numeric(precision, scale), set the Precision to 10, and select OK.

    ![The information above is entered in the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, and OK is selected at the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image187.png "Specify the settings")

26. Select Apply on the Type mapping tab. 
    
    ![The row with source type of number is highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Apply is highlighted at the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image188.png "Select Apply")

27. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, right-click the EMPLOYEETERRITORIES table, and select Convert Schema. 
    
    ![Convert Schema is highlighted in the submenu of the EMPLOYEETERRITORIES table in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image189.png "Select Convert Schema")

28. When prompted that the target exists, select Overwrite. 
    
    ![Overwrite is selected and highlighted in the Target Exists prompt.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image190.png "Select Overwrite")

29. Notice the error is now gone from the Error List.

30. We are going to fix another data type conversion issue now, which will otherwise appear when we attempt to migrate the data.

31. Select the ORDER\_DETAILS table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer. 
    
    ![The ORDER\_DETAILS table is selected and highlighted in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image191.png "Select the ORDER_DETAILS table ")

32. Next, you are going to convert the type associated with the DISCOUNT column, FLOAT(23) to a numeric(10, 0), similar to what you did for the EMPLOYEETERRITORIES table.

33. Select the Type Mapping tab, then select float\[\*..53\] from the Source Type list, and select Edit. 
    
    ![The row with source type of float\[\*..53\] is selected and highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Edit is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image192.png "Edit float[*..53]")

34. In the Edit Type Mapping dialog, change the Target type to numeric(precision, scale), and set the Precision to 10, then select OK.

    ![In the Edit Type Mapping dialog box, numeric(precision, scale) is highlighted under Target type, 10 is highlighted next to Replace with under Precision, and OK is highlighted at the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image193.png "Change the Target type")

35. Select Apply to save the changes to the ORDER\_DETAILS table. 
    
    ![The row with source type of float\[\*..53\] is selected and highlighted on the Type Mapping tab, and Apply is highlighted at the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image194.png "Apply float[*..53]")

36. Now, right-click on the ORDER\_DETAILS table in the Oracle Metadata Explorer, and select Convert Schema. 
    
    ![Convert Schema is highlighted in the submenu of the ORDER\_DETAILS table in Oracle Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image195.png "Select Convert Schema")

37. When prompted that the target exists, select Overwrite. 
    
    ![Overwrite is selected and highlighted in the Target Exists prompt.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image196.png "Target Exists prompt")

38. \[Optional\] Save the project. This can take a while, and is not necessary to complete the hands-on lab.

39. To apply the resultant schema to the Northwind database in SQL Server, use the SQL Server Metadata Explorer to view the Northwind database. Right-click Northwind, and select Synchronize with Database. 
    
    ![Synchronize with Database is highlighted in the submenu of the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image197.png "Select Synchronize with Database")

40. Select OK in the Synchronize with the Database dialog.

41. The Synchronize action will result in multiple errors in the Error List, resulting from attempting to add the SSMA assemblies to the Northwind database. 
    
    ![The Errors notification is highlighted at the top of the Errors List window, and the first of multiple errors is selected and highlighted in the Message list.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image198.png "View the errors")

42. These errors are the result of improvements implemented in SQL Server 2017 SQLCLR security model. Specifically, in SQL Server 2017, Microsoft now by default requires that all type of assemblies (SAFE, EXTERNAL\_ACCESS, UNSAFE) are authorized for UNSAFE access.

43. For this hands-on lab, you will be adding the assemblies causing the errors to the trusted assembly list, which is synonymous with whitelisting the assemblies. To fix these errors, complete the following:

    -   Under the Northwind database in the SQL Server Metadata Explorer in SSMA, expand Assemblies. 
        
        ![Three items are listed below Assemblies, which is highlighted below the Northwind database in SQL Server Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image199.png "Expand Assemblies")

    -   Right-click SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET, and select Save as Script. 
        
        ![Save as Script is highlighted in the submenu for SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image200.png "Select Save as Script")

    -   Save the script to the local machine.

    -   Now, you will need to use SSMS on your SqlServerDw VM.

        -   Open an RDP connection to your SqlServerDw VM, if one is not already open.

        -   Open SSMS 17.

        -   Connect to the SQL Server 2017 instance (SqlServerDw), by selecting Connect, and entering SqlServerDw into the Server name field.

        -   Expand Databases.

        -   Right-click on Northwind, and select New Query.

        -   Paste the following query into the new query window.
    ```
    USE master;

    GO

    DECLARE @clrName nvarchar(4000) = 'SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET'

    DECLARE @asmBin varbinary(max) = [INSERT BINARY];

    DECLARE @hash varbinary(64);

    SELECT @hash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', @asmBin);

    EXEC sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly @hash = @hash, @description = @clrName;
    ```

    -   Now, return to your Lab VM, and open the saved SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET.sql file from the desktop with Notepad.exe.

    -   Within the SQL file, locate the line that begins with CREATE ASSEMBLY, then locate the word FROM. Copy the binary string that appears after FROM. This value will span all the way down to the line containing the text "WITH PERMISSION\_SET = SAFE". Be sure not to include any whitespace at the end of the binary value.
    
    ![The binary string that appears after FROM is highlighted within the SQL file.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image201.png "Copy the binary string")

    -   Now, return to SSMS on your SqlServerDw VM, and replace \[INSERT BINARY\] with the copied binary value. The line should end with ";" and there should be no whitespace before the ";".

    -   Execute the query in SSMS.

44. Repeat step 34, this time for the assembly SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET. Make sure to replace the \@clrName variable in the script with the value "SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET".

45. The SSMA assemblies have now been whitelisted in SQL Server 2017.

46. Return to SSMA on your Lab VM, and rerun the Synchronize with Database action on the Northwind database. This will create all the schema objects in the SQL Server Northwind database. There should now be no errors, and the Output pane should show Synchronization operation is complete.

47. Now you need to migrate the data.

48. In the Oracle Metadata Explorer, select NW and from the command bar, select Migrate Data. 
    
    ![Migrate Data is highlighted in the command bar of Oracle Metadata Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image202.png "Select Migrate Data")

49. You will be prompted to re-enter your Oracle credentials for use by the migration connection.

    -   Recall the Oracle credentials are:

        -   Server name: localhost

        -   Server port: 1521

        -   Oracle SID: XE

        -   User name: NW

        -   Password: oracledemo123

    -   The SQL Server credentials are:

        -   Server name: IP address of your SqlServerDw VM (obtained in the essentials area of your VM's blade in Azure portal)

        -   Server port: \[default\]

        -   Authentication: SQL Server Authentication

        -   User name: sa

        -   Password: Password.1!!

50. Select Connect.

51. After the migration completes, you will be presented with a Data Migration Report, similar to the following: 

    ![This is screenshot of an example Data Migration Report.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image203.png "View the Data Migration Report")

## Exercise 7: Migrate the Application

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will modify the NorthwindMVC application, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle.

### Task 1: Create a new Entity Model against SQL Server

1.  On your Lab VM, return to Visual Studio, and open Web.config from the Solution Explorer.

2.  Modify the connection string named SqlServerConnectionString to match your remote SQL Server credentials.

    -   Replace the value of "data source" with your SqlServerDw VM's public IP address.

    -   Replace the value of "password" with Password.1!!.
    
    ![The information above is highlighted in Web.config.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image204.png "Replace the password value")

3.  Build the solution, by selecting Build in the Visual Studio menu, then selecting Build Solution. 
    
    ![Build and Build Solution are highlighted in Visual Studio.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image162.png "Select Build Solution")

4.  In the Solution Explorer, expand the Data folder, and select all the files within the folder.

8.  In the Add New Item dialog, expand Visual C\#, select Data, and select ADO.NET Entity Data Model. Enter DataContext for the name, and select Add.
    
    ![In the Add New Item dialog box, Visual C\#, Data, ADO.NET Entity Data Model, and DataContext are highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image208.png "Add DataContext")

9.  In the wizard's Choose Model Contents dialog, select Code First from database, and select Next. 
    
    ![Code First from database is highlighted under What should the model contain? in the Entity Data Model Wizard.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image209.png "Select Code First from database")

10. In the Choose Your Data Connection dialog, select SqlServerConnectionString (Settings) from the drop down, and select Yes, include the sensitive data in the connection string. Uncheck Save connection settings in Web.Config, and select Next. 
    
    ![SqlServerConnectionString (Settings) and Yes, include the sensitive data in the connection string are selected and highlighted in the Entity Data Model Wizard, and Save connection settings in Web.Config is cleared.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image210.png "Choose Your Data Connection settings")

11. In the Connect to SQL Server dialog, enter the Password, Password.1!!. 
    
    ![The password above is entered in the Connect to SQL Server dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image211.png "Enter the Password")

12. On the Choose Your Database Objects and Settings screen, expand the Tables node, and check NW only. Ensure Pluralize or singularize generated column names is checked.
    
    ![The Tables node is selected, and NW is selected and highlighted in the Entity Data Model Wizard. Pluralize or singularize generated column names is also selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image212.png "Choose Your Database Objects and Settings")

13. Select Finish, and the model will be generated. This may take a few minutes.

### Task 2: Modify Application Code

1.  In Visual Studio, open the file DataContext.cs from the Solution Explorer. You may need to collapse the Data folder, and re-expand it after refreshing if you don't see the file listed.
    
    ![DataContext.cs is highlighted under the Data folder in Solution Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image213.png "Open DataContext.cs")

2.  The call to base in the DataContext constructor, at the top of the file, needs to be updated to reflect the correct connection string.

    ![In the DataContext constructor, : base ("name=DataContext") is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image214.png "Update the call to base")

3.  Change the line from:

    : base ("name=DataContext")

4.  To:

    : base ("name=SqlServerConnectionString")

5.  Save the file.

    ![In the DataContext constructor, : base ("name=SqlServerConnectionString") is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image215.png "Update the call to base")

6.  Next, open the file HomeController.cs, in the Controllers folder in the Solution Explorer. 
    
    ![The HomeController.cs file is selected and highlighted under the Controllers folder in Solution Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Dataplatformupgradeandmigrationimages/media/image216.png "Open HomeController.cs")
