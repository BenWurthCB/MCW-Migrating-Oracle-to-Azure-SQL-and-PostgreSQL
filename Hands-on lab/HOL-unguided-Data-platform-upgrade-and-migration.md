# Data Platform upgrade and migration hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will implement a proof of concept (POC) for conducting a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that will need to be updated, and come up with a migration plan. In addition, you will help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as conduct a migration from an old version of SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to design and build a database migration plan and implement any required application changes associated with changing database technologies.

## Overview

World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced significant growth in the last few years. In addition to predictable growth, they’ve had a substantial amount of growth in the data they store in their data warehouse. Their data warehouse is starting to show its age; slowing down during extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations and during critical queries. It was built on SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition.

The WWI CIO has recently read about new performance enhancements of Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2017. She is excited about the potential performance improvements related to clustered ColumnStore indexes. She is also hoping that table compression will improve performance and backup times.

WWI is concerned about upgrading their database to Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017. The data warehouse has been successful for a long time. As it has grown, it has filled with data, stored procedures, views, and security. WWI wants assurance that if it moves its data store, it won’t run into any incompatibilities with the storage engine of Azure SQL Database or SQL Server 2017.

WWI’s CIO would like a POC of a data warehouse move and proof that the new technology will help ETL and query performance.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram is divided in to Microsoft Azure, and On Premises. Microsoft Azure includes SQL Server 2017 in a VM as an Always On Secondary, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse for a stretch table. On Premise includes the following elements: API App for vendor connections; Web App for Internet Sales Transactions; ASP.NET Core App for inventory management; SQL Server 2017 OLTP for Always On and JSON store; SSRS 2017 for Reporting of OLTP, Data Warehouse, and Cubes; SSIS 2017 for a Data Warehouse Load; Excel for reporting; SQL Server 2017 Enterprise for a Data Warehouse; and SSAS 2017 for a Data Warehouse. ](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to perform an assessment to see what potentials issues need to be addressed in upgrading the database to SQL Server 2017 or Azure SQL Database. After correcting any issues, the SQL Server 2008 database is migrated to Azure SQL Database, using the Azure Database Migration Service. Two features of Azure SQL Database, Table Compression and ColumnStore Index, will be applied to demonstrate value and performance improvements from the upgrade. For the ColumnStore Index, a new table based on the existing FactResellerSales table will be created, and a ColumnStore index applied. Next, the Oracle XE database supporting the application will be migrated to an on-premises SQL Server 2017 Enterprise instance using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) 7.x for Oracle. Once the Oracle database has been migrated, the NorthwindMVC application will be updated, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle. The entity models are updated against SQL Server, and code updates are made to use the new Entity Framework context based on SQL Server. Corrections to stored procedures are made due to differences in how stored procedures are accessed in Oracle versus SQL Server.

- Using Database Explorer provided under the Fusion menu installed by dbForge Fusion in Visual Studio, create a connection to the Oracle database.
- Run the SQL scripts in order provided under the Oracle Scripts folder of the starter.

#### Exit Criteria

- You have created the Northwind database with schema and data in Oracle.

### Task 6: Configure the Starter Application to use Oracle

In this task, you will add the necessary configuration to the NorthwindMVC solution to connect to the Oracle database you created in the previous task.

#### Tasks to Complete

- Modify the web.config of the NorthwindMVC web app so the OracleConnectionString points to your Oracle instance of Northwind.

#### Exit Criteria

- You can run the application and see the Dashboard from Northwind Traders load.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Northwind Traders Dashboard.](./media/northwind-traders-dashboard.png "View the dashboard")

## Exercise 5: Migrate the Oracle database to SQL Server 2017

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will migrate the Oracle database into SQL Server 2017 using SSMA.

### Task 1: Migrate the Oracle database to SQL Server 2017 using SSMA

#### Tasks to Complete

- Use SSMA to migrate the schema and data from the NW database on Oracle to the Northwind database in SQL Server 2017.
  - Fix data type errors reported during schema conversion
  - In SQL Server 2017, Microsoft now by default requires that all type of assemblies (SAFE, EXTERNAL_ACCESS, UNSAFE) are authorized for UNSAFE access. Add the `SSMA4OracleSQLServerCollections.NET` and `SSMA4OracleSQLServerExtensions.NET` assemblies to the SQLCLR whitelist for the SQL Server 2017 instance.
  - Execute the script below in SSMS for each assembly. Note: The binary value for each assembly can be obtained by saving the assemblies as a script in SSMA.

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    DECLARE @clrName nvarchar(4000) = '[INSERT ASSEMBLY NAME]'
    DECLARE @asmBin varbinary(max) = [INSERT BINARY];
    DECLARE @hash varbinary(64);

    SELECT @hash = HASHBYTES('SHA2_512', @asmBin);

    EXEC sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly @hash = @hash, @description = @clrName;
    ```

#### Exit Criteria

- Your Northwind database in SQL Server has the schema objects and the tables have data.

## Exercise 6: Migrate the application

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you will modify the NorthwindMVC application, so it targets SQL Server 2017 instead of Oracle.

### Task 1: Create a new Entity Model against SQL Server

#### Tasks to Complete

- Modify the web.config so that SqlServerConnectionString is correct for your environment.
- Delete the existing entity model present in the files under the Data folder in Solution explorer.
- Connect to the SQL Server database through Server Explorer in Visual Studio.
- Create a new Code First model against the SQL Server database.

#### Exit Criteria

- You have successfully generated a new model.

### Task 2: Modify Application Code

#### Tasks to Complete

- Change the DataContext to use your SqlServerConnectionString.
- Within `HomeController.cs` uncomment the SQL Server specific code and comment out the Oracle specific code.
- Modify `SALESBYYEAR.cs` so that `YEAR` is of type int and `SUBTOTAL` is of type decimal.
- Modify `SalesByYearViewModel.cs` so that `Year` is of type int.
- Run the SALES_BY_YEAR_fix.sql

#### Exit Criteria

- You can run the application and see the dashboard showing correctly, this time with data coming from SQL Server.

    ![This is a screenshot of the Northwind Traders Dashboard.](./media/northwind-traders-dashboard.png "View the dashboard")

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 mins

In this exercise, you will delete any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab. You should follow all steps provided after attending the Hands-on lab to ensure your account does not continue to be charged for lab resources.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group

1. Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting Resource groups in the left menu.
2. Search for the name of your research group, and select it from the list.
3. Select Delete in the command bar, and confirm the deletion by re-typing the Resource group name, and selecting Delete.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
