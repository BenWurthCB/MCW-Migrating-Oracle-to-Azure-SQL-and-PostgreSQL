<h2 id="abstract-and-learning-objectives">Abstract and learning objectives</h2>
<p>This hands-on lab is designed to help attendees better understand how to build a Proof-of-Concept (POC) and conduct a site analysis for a customer to compare cost, performance, and level of effort required to migrate from Oracle to SQL Server. You will evaluate the dependent applications and reports that will need to be updated and come up with a migration plan. In addition, attendees will help the customer take advantage of new SQL Server features to improve performance and resiliency, as well as explore ways to migrate from an old version of SQL Server to the newest version and consider the impact of migrating from on-premises to the cloud.</p>
<p>Learning Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Migrate from Oracle to SQL Server using SQL Server Migration Assistant</p></li>
<li><p>Migrate between different SQL Server editions using Data Migration Assistant</p></li>
<li><p>Use advanced SQL Server features, such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data store, table compression, Transparent Data Encryption, and clustered ColumnStore indexing</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the steps required to update existing applications to use the new data platform</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze and improve database performance</p></li>
<li><p>Implement high availability using Stretch Database and AlwaysOn Availability Groups</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-1-review-the-customer-case-study">Step 1: Review the customer case study</h2>
<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Analyze your customer’s needs. Time frame: 15 minutes Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips. 1. Meet your table participants and trainer 2. Read all of the directions for steps 1–3 in the student guide 3. As a table team, review the following customer case study</p>
<h3 id="customer-situation">Customer situation</h3>
<p>World Wide Importers (WWI) has experienced huge growth over the last few years. With that growth has come a tremendous influx in new data they need to maintain their business. This data has become increasingly expensive to store in an Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS). Oracle upgrades are long and expensive projects. Business stake holders have tired of the process and have requested a proof of concept (POC) on replacing Oracle with Microsoft SQL Server.</p>
<p>WWI is investigating ways they can increase speed on their transactional databases without expensive new license fees. They’re also concerned with keeping their transactional system available and online for their store. They’ve noticed that Oracle has been slowing down as their growth has doubled. They realize they will need a new investment in hardware and are looking at this as more of a migration to a new system.</p>
<p>WWI has several external and internal applications that need to migrate with the database. The database is used by an online store application, written in ASP.NET MVC. They also have internal applications that manage their product catalog, written in Oracle Forms. In addition, they have many reports to aid in forecasting, sales reporting, and inventory maintenance. Those reports are a mixture of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), Excel, and Oracle Forms and hit the Oracle OLTP database directly.</p>
<p>WWI also uses this database to interact with vendors. Several of their vendors require real-time access to their sales data through an API so they can draw warranty information on date of sale. They do this through a Representational State Transfer (REST) service that is maintained by WWI.</p>
<p>WWI also loads the Oracle database into a Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition data warehouse. The head of IT constantly fails an audit where he is asked if their data warehouse encrypts data at rest. He realizes he needs to upgrade to the Enterprise Edition and would like to include an upgrade in this POC.</p>
<p>Before WWI invests in this project, they want a proof of concept that encompasses these touch points and proves that it can be successful.</p>
<p>WWI also has a new requirement. They have an existing web service that interacts with a vendor to get the latest certifications of that vendors’ products. The JSON parser sometimes fails and they can’t figure out why. They’d like to store the initial, unparsed JSON in a table for troubleshooting purposes. They would like to query the JSON data by date or by other identifying pieces of the JSON that might be available for troubleshooting. They want to know the best way to do that.</p>
<p>Also, they had a significant outage last year because one of their audit tables ran out of space. They had to wait many hours to resolve the issue while their IT department scrambled to make space on an already overloaded Storage Area Network (SAN). They would like a full briefing on how to monitor that situation, so it doesn’t happen again, and possible remedies if it does happen again. They would also like high availability to be built into the project plan and are wondering what additional fees that would incur.</p>
<p>Kathleen Sloan, the CIO of WWI, is looking to decrease their software license fees, take advantage of a modern data warehouse, and provide a strong vision of availability for the future that will handle their momentous growth. She is sold on SQL Server, but her Oracle DBAs keep telling her that a migration to SQL Server is simply impossible. They cite that they have never done it before. They say it’s hard to find tools that make it possible. The Oracle DBAs say that SQL Server is not as high performing as Oracle, does not have great high availability like Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC), and doesn’t have a replacement for Oracle Forms. She’s tired of hearing no whenever the topic is brought up and would love to prove them wrong. She is also exploring the cloud and is wondering if she can make a direct migration to a cloud database or if she must stay on-premises because of her requirements. She has seen SQL Server make tremendous gains in features over the last several versions, particularly in business intelligence. Her data warehouse has slowed down as the data has increased. On one hand, this is because the data warehouse SQL Server has gotten very popular, but it’s still a negative in her mind. She’s concerned about the upgrade path because of all the dependencies on the data warehouse in her organization.</p>

<li><p>Wants more understanding on what to do with the internal Oracle Forms application</p></li>
<li><p>Has multiple touch points with external vendors and needs to know what needs to change with those web services</p></li>
<li><p>Wants to upgrade their existing data warehouse from SQL Server 2008 Standard Edition to SQL Server 2017 Enterprise Edition to take advantage of some new features:</p>
<ul>

<li><p>They want compression for some of their large fact tables.</p></li>
<li><p>They want to implement SSRS mobile reporting</p></li>
<li><p>They hear about in-memory structures and are wondering if they can benefit from those. They aren’t entirely sure how it is different from what they are using now.</p></li>
<li><p>They have a lot of SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages that are executed through SQL Server Agent jobs. They’d like to know the upgrade path for those.</p></li>
